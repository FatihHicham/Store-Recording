    "1": "Hi! I am Jamal, a Moroccan Man based in Sweden with a real passion for Argan Product. My favourite activities include day dreaming, laughing extremely hard, exploring the world, swimming in the ocean and eating chocolate. I am passionate about Products cosmitic and i love sharing my knewlege and cultural heritage. I like to develop recipes that are simple and balanced but most importantly that are inspired from my home country. On top of being a fun and tasty activity, I feel that Cosmitic products is also a way to explore and connect different cultures and I love to do it by putting my own twist into Moroccan classics. I grew up in Morocco in a family seriously obsessed with trade. While growing up, my mama and papa – my main inspiration – always filled our Products with Moroccan and did their best to bring our culture to my brothers and me. I moved to Sweden a few years ago , only to realize my interest in Project cosmitic was in fact a real passion."
